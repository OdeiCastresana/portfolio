🧒​ I’m a voracious reader, an athlete (not elite), an active investor and an industrial electronic engineer.

📚​ I love reading and I’m really excited to share my favourite books with you.

💸​ My investment portfolio isn’t a gold mine, but I’d love to encourage young people to see investment as a powerful and very useful tool.

🌍​ I reside in Switzerland, however, I´m from Spain. I would like to develop an international career and share the experiences and knowledge.
